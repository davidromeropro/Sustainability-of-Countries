Este grupo puede representar países o regiones que están menos desarrollados y tienen una gran dependencia de los combustibles fósiles para la energía, lo que resulta en altos niveles de contaminación del aire y mortalidad.

La alta dependencia de combustibles limpios y la baja tasa de mortalidad podrían indicar un nivel relativamente alto de desarrollo y acceso a los recursos, mientras que la baja proporción de energía renovable y la falta de educación para el desarrollo sostenible podrían sugerir la necesidad de una mayor inversión en desarrollo sostenible.</p></li>

Este grupo puede representar países o regiones desarrollados con un nivel de vida relativamente alto y sistemas educativos sólidos que dan prioridad al desarrollo sostenible.

Este grupo puede representar países o regiones que dan prioridad al desarrollo sostenible y han avanzado en la transición a fuentes de energía más limpias. La alta dependencia de combustibles limpios, la baja tasa de mortalidad y el alto índice de educación sugieren un nivel de vida relativamente alto y un fuerte compromiso con el desarrollo sostenible. Sin embargo, la tasa de crecimiento anual negativa sugiere posibles desafíos económicos.</p></li>

<h1>Conclusiones</h1>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Los modelos de machine learning representan una alternativa para evaluar la sostenibilidad y pueden ser utilizados en conjunto con modelos matemáticos como SAFE.</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>La imputación de datos es un proceso complejo que puede presentar desafíos significativos. La falta de datos o los datos incompletos pueden afectar negativamente la calidad del análisis y la precisión de los resultados.</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Una recomendación para predecir el nivel de desarrollo de los países es utilizar modelos no paramétricos. Además, se podría aplicar la técnica de Variational Auto Encoders para reducir la dimensionalidad de los datos y agrupar los países en categorías similares.</p></li>
